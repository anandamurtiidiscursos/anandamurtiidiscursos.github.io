Early in the kundalini awakening when I was still a student in the university, I had many experiences that shook my world apart.  There was a period where I had many strange visions that didn’t make sense to me until years later.  During meditation I would feel that I was merging into the whole city of Austin around me.   My mind would expand outward beyond the city and I would get lost in bliss.  It was terrifying yet exhilarating.  It was the death of the little "I," In one of these experiences I had a waking dream in which I knew I was seeing myself 5 years in the future.  I was in Austin but on a farm outside the city where I was very happy and at peace.  I thought to myself that it was absurd because I had no plans of remaining in Austin after graduation.  I forgot all about this dream until I found myself at this very same farm 5 years later.  The details of the vision like a telephone line crossing the property by a creek proved exact.  Meanwhile, back in '94, the vision continued.  In the next part of the vision I knew it was 10 years into the future now and the scene changed.  I was in Mexico in the middle of a war.  I felt very tense in this part of the vision but the scene changed into a third scene where I was far above Austin, almost in outer space.  I looked down and the world was very different.  The coast line was much more inward.  There were fewer people but there was much more respect between them.  I saw that they understood the lesson that nature gave them.    I didn’t know when in the future this third part of the vision occurred, just that it was sometime after the Mexico part.  I wasn’t even sure if I was alive on the planet, or floating without a body in some ethereal space from where I was observing in the dream.  It didn’t matter because there was finally peace.

I don’t necessarily believe in prophecies, but when a vision has proven right 2 out of 3 times, then my ears start to perk up a little about the third part.
