### The Dynamics of “Ga” and “Gha” through Expansion and Love

The spiritual heart is the Anahata Vortex. Anahata means “not holding.”
It is the intuitive level of mind that begins to understand that there is an
infinite vastness and dignity inside itself and can begin to let go of blind
attachments caused by an underlying sense of fear and insecurity.
The intuitive mind of Anahata vibrates in tune with the Aerial Factor, a
very fine form of matter or prana that manifests its intentions toward form,
yet being beyond form itself. When completely purified this prana no
longer needs to vibrate with the vrttis or vortexes of the mind. The breath
stops completely. One is empty of form, but full of bliss. One hears the
inner logos of Shiva, all the sounds that make up Om, and sees how fine
vibrations of prana manifest the entire material universe. These rhythmic
vibrations or “strings" or pulses of prana stem from the “root" sounds of the
Causal Mind, the logos of Shiva. One day the human genius will be able
to map and even quantify these fine vibrations that make up the so-called
“quantum void.” Then, human beings will begin to understand the secrets
of the dimensions between mind and matter.

Until this placation of the spiritual heart, the vrttis of the Anahata will
continue to guide and develop our awareness toward this understanding.
These fine sounds of the vrttis will vibrate the mind and attempt to
regulate the endocrine and nervous systems so that they can develop
higher functions. The 3rd and 4th vortexes of the Anahata Vortex are
controlled by the sounds “ga” and “gha.” “Ga” manifests a tendency
towards self-expansion and development of latent qualities, and “gha”
manifests a tendency toward deep, human affection, or love.

Before the manifestation of the vrtti of expansion, the mind’s
“endeavor” is really expansion of the ego based on conquests of physical
space and material or acquisitions psychic meaning for the separate,
fearful, ego-dominated personality. This is the world of action and reaction.
The separate ego is always trying to find meaning and security to
compensate for its isolation and fear. One tries to fit into the social and
economic systems with ready-made patterns. These patterns most often do
not harmonize with the cosmological order and we suffer reactions
accordingly.

With the vrtti of endeavor at the Anahata the latent qualities of the
Macrocosmic Mind, the repository of infinite, omniscient knowledge, can
begin to manifest themselves. New qualities, interests and subtle desires
begin to manifest in the personality. It is a psychic instinct that directs us
toward greater meaning at the intuitive level of mind. Where did your
spiritual and creative desires come from and when exactly did they start?
What hidden force directed you toward certain people, certain places,
books, or practices that opened up your inner spiritual life? At the intuitive
level of mind we begin to realize that there is an inner vastness that is
really living our lives and really knows how to do it. One only has to
convince the separate ego to go along with this flow.

“Gha”, the vibration that regulates affection, is the counter-balance of
endeavor, or “ga.” Knowledge via expansion of the mind is useful to solve
existential problems and it is imperative that this knowledge be developed
in all spheres of existence- physical, social, psychological and spiritual.
However, no form of knowledge is complete without love, without a greater
human purpose for this knowledge. At the anahata level, reason and
affection aren’t yet separated. Head and heart are one. And it is possible
that all of the finer human qualities and intelligence may serve us not in an
accelerated collective destruction, but toward universal love and justice. It
is only when the warmth of deep human love is missing that the mind
becomes a rogue mind that constantly devours itself and others and keeps
itself forever separate from the intuitive order of existence. Spiritual
knowledge without the development of the finer, loving qualities of the
personality is an impossibility. This level of love is not yet universal
compassion because there are still finer needs of personal significance.
However, the development of these higher emotive functions eventually
lead one toward universal love or compassion, a quality of the Vishuddha
(5th) vortex, an even higher level of human consciousness. Here, one is so
close to the Atman that there remain few, if any, personal needs and one
only loves without any expectation or desire of reciprocation. When
Anahata is purified it becomes a direct conduit for the Causal Mind of
Vishuddha.

Endeavor

Endeavor is the effort to unfold enfolded or dormant qualities of the
personality. We see that with the Anahata that there is the ability to think
in a very deep and meaningful way. With this sublime ability the mind can
probe into the deepest grounds of thought potential to discover and create
new modes of being for itself that further the expansion of human potential
and knowledge of existence. At the Manipura (3rd vortex) there was still the
impulsive hunger for expanding the mind in relation to its external
conceptual world. With the vrtti of endeavor the mind can expand itself not
merely by assimilating more of its outer environment, but by finding inner,
intuitive qualities that broaden and enlighten the concept of self. Endeavor
is the effort to discover who we really are on the inside. Now that there is a
greater degree of Mahat (self-reflecting awareness, “I exist”) and therefore
intuition, with a corresponding decrease in the externalized intellect, the
mind begins to question what the “I” truly is. At this stage the personality
is very well aware of the limited ego-driven tendencies and seeks to know
the reality and identity behind these limitations. And it is only when the
limited ego is frustrated with its external expansion and clearly sees its own
bondages that the desire to realize its inner and fuller potential is aroused.
Here one truly sees the life of incessant self-concern, ambition, and
attachment as the illusion of Self. With the manifestation of Mahat or “I-
feeling” and intuition one can look down upon the fray and ask "who is it
that sees all of this?" There is a calm, quiescent eye in the storm of the
self and one begins to desire what it is and how to attain it. Endeavor is
quite simply the desire for the understanding of Tao, of dharma.

However, this movement is endeavor to realize and not realization itself.
The ego here assumes the qualities and identity necessary to live in
accordance with a deeper understanding and experience of existence. It is
not ensconsement and establishment in the intuitive life but the movement
toward that. Instead of the ego having an image of itself in accordance
with its external desires, it now manifests the qualities that help in its
psycho-spiritual orientation. Such qualities are necessarily ones that help
to understand, accept, and integrate the lower propensities into a more
refined self-concept. Such qualities are an acute awareness, non-judgment
of self and others, acceptance, compassion, moral conscience and an
adamant resolve to bring these qualities into expression.

While discussing this growth of self it is necessary to mention the 3 laws
that regulate the unfolding of higher propensities to incorporate and
compensate for the lower. These laws are recapitulation, transmutation,
and integration. It is clearly seen now how successive levels of
development grow through previous levels and that the vrttis at higher
vortexes are a similar though more refined expression of the lower vrttis.
The vrttis recapitulate themselves in successively higher modus operandi.
The mind isn’t entering entirely new form as it evolves to higher levels;
things are just restated in a more subtle way. For example, endeavor isn't
impulsive like its predecessor, craving (at the Manipura), but both have to
do with mental expansion. Due to the fact that there are higher, more
conscious tendencies that correspond to more subtle levels of existence,
there is by necessity a transmutation of the energy used in the expression
of the lower as it moves toward the higher. Endeavor requires patience and
deep awareness, not forced and willful activity as in craving. Vrttis are
ingrained tendencies, mental instincts, that have evolved to serve an
evolutionary purpose and so there isn’t a rapid, immediate transition from
the old to the new. The new has to be born into being and the old will
continue to assert itself. This evolutionary shift in mental expression
therefore requires tremendous energy conversion. This process happens
unconsciously through an innate and expansive guiding faculty as well as
through the will and choice. One can decide to move along and follow one's
inner voice that is leading the transmutation. If not, then there is always
trouble. A factor necessary for the successful transmutation of the higher
frequency of mental energy is integration. The old must be incorporated
into the new. That old expression of energy must be entirely directed into
the new faculty; otherwise the mind will be split in that there are now
opposing expressions of mind. This split may either to duplicity, a
regression to previous modes of behavior or a repression of the lower by
the higher. To use our previous example, the spiritually oriented personality
propelled by the endeavor vrtti may repress his ambitious tendencies from
his conscious awareness, but these old ambitious and willful tendencies still
have an energetic momentum to assert themselves unconsciously. He may
therefore express duplicity or hypocrisy by saying one thing and
unconsciously doing another. A similar psychological dissociation of the
lower from the higher was mentioned while discussing worry and will be
dealt with more when discussing the vrttis of vanity, selfishness, duplicity,
and argumentativeness as these tendencies reveal an incomplete
integration of lower vrttis into the self-reflective, intuitive, and
magnanimous potentialities of the Anahata.

This dissociation of the newly emerging tendencies from the old,
ingrained behavior patterns produces what classical psychology has termed
the shadow. The shadow doesn’t reside in one particular kosa, in other
words it is not a layer of mind. It is a defaulted mechanism of integration
from one mental-emotive level to the next. Whatever is not accepted and
integrated and therefore either repressed or suppressed is relegated into
the shadowy category of the “not me.” For example, if the mind doesn’t
have the vigor to make the jump from the Svadhistana (2 nd vortex) to the
Manipura (3rd vortex), then the entropic vrttis of the Svadhistana become
the shadow for the vigorous and ambitious mind that is trying to function at
the Manipura level. The entropy of the Svadhistana vrttis will complicate
and confound the autocratic Manipura vrttis. The externally driven
personality may suppress his/her tendencies that are associated with
insecurity and lack of confidence. In a similar manner, if the jump to the
Anahata from Manipura is not complete, as in our previous example, then
the vrttis or cluster of vrttis that constituted the former personality at the
Manipura become the shadow.

Affection

The affection of one sentient being for another as expressed through
this tendency at the Anahata is not one of an intense desire to consume
and possess another solely to gratify one's own appetites. The quality of
interpersonal dialogue at the Anahata is a mutual, inter-subjective regard.
There is a love based on the deeply human qualities of another. It is not
completely selfless, however. Here there is still a desire to hold onto the
qualities of another because of the deep meaning (artha) that is given. This
form of attachment isn't to satiate one’s hunger for external expansion but
is a fondness for the other based on the way that others affect them in a
deep and soulful way. With affection one's heart is touched by another. The
inner qualities of another are loved by means of the deeper qualities of the
one who loves. In this dialogue the one who is loved is regarded for who
they really are on the inside and the lover exercises and discovers more of
his/her deeply human affective capacities.

Human love, whether intimate and romantic, familial, or brotherly has
such a tremendous hold over us that it both liberates our hearts from self-
enclosure while at the same time holds us only to those that we personally
love. Affection must be perfectly balanced in order to bring happiness,
otherwise it breeds suffering. It brings happiness when the regard we have
for others supersedes our own selfish wants and demands and thereby
propels us beyond self-interest. Affection always leads to obstacles when it
is exploited. This is done by placing the importance of the personal
meaning that it gives us and the demand to keep receiving it over the true
needs of others. In the words of William Blake, “Love seeketh not itself to
please, nor for itself hath any care. It gladly gives itself with ease and
creates a heaven in hell's despair.”

Many love only to receive love and recognition from others without
giving much themselves. Only when affection reaches a functional synergy
or symbiosis where both the lover and the loved interchange roles freely,
both harmoniously giving and receiving, that a person can truly begin to
realize the higher function of love. Human love in all of its forms is an
intimation, an emerging expression of divine love. Love is the only seed of
spirituality. One who is loved feels worthy and whole, regarded and
respected. The one who loves sees the power of transformation upon
another by and from their own emotive forces within.

Once the person feels love-worthy by others a noble confidence and self-
respect, or respectful Self awareness is gained that permits one to love
freely, without fear, selfish demands and an imposing personal need. And
are not fear, selfishness, and our personal demands and insistence the
tendencies that reflect a lack of true confidence, Self awareness and self-
respect, and therefore, a lack of love? Only a strong and integrated mind
can truly love. At this level of personal integration one understands how
love is the essential element, the magic elixir for the growth of soul that
cures all of the fear, selfishness, and suffering in life. One sees how oneself
has been transformed by it and cant help but want to share it with others.
This is the culmination of personal love: to love without strings attached
and not to expect anything in return. Love ceases to be a mere feeling or
personal need but rather a spiritual principle with the deepest meaning and
power. When this stage is reached an even deeper and universal spiritual
love can begin to emerge. This more exalted tendency is at the Vishuddha
(5th vortex). Love and affection begins at the Anahata but reaches its fullest
expression at the Vishuddha. Here affection as artha (personal meaning) is
fully transformed into dharma (universal and essential meaning). In the
end there is but one Friend, in many colors and in many places, who moves
through infinite love behind all our faces.
