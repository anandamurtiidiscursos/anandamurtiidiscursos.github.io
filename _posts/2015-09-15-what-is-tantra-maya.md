Tantra Maya is a synthesis between the ancient spiritual practices of the Maya and the modern tantra philosophy of Ananda Marga.  My wife was a student of Quetzal Manik, a Mayan healer and yogi from Campeche.  She interprets "maya" as the spiritual practices of the mayan people.  I interpret "maya" according to the Sanskrit definition: the divine mystery of how the infinite being hides itself in the finite realm through each and every being only to eventually desire a return to a state of essential oneness with the infinite consciousness.  Tantra Maya is therefore the advanced and experimental study of Tantra as a universal intuitive science as well as a system of Mayan meditation.  The Tantra Maya healing and meditation practices are remarkably similar to the oriental practices of Tantra Yoga.  

Perhaps with further investigation one may find a link between them and some schools of Shaeva Tantra (Tantra inspired by Shiva).  Anandamurti, the preceptor of Ananda Marga, systematized the ancient practices of the Tantric Yogis of India with very lucid, modern interpretations.  His Ananda Marga philosophy has been preserved in over 200 works that Anandamurti himself dictated.  Tantra Maya uses the Mayan spiritual meditative practices of Quetzal Manik along with the tantra philosophy of Anandamurti as a rational guide and inspiration for these subtle, introspective practices.
