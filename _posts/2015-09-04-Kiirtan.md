Baba Nam Kevalam is a Sanskrit mantra that means “Only Love Is.” There is no other reality than this infinite bliss. We may approach It in so many ways: through sublime thoughts, good actions with sincere love for others and even through aesthetics. This mantra can be sung or chanted with any elevating melody and with any style of music. We use it as a form of spiritual practice to purify the environment and prepare for meditation. It also generates such positivity that protects us from the dangers here in our local community. The following is one of our recent recordings with the intention of driving the Santa Muerte out of our valley.
